**APIs**

1. Using the NCBI API, look for papers that show up under the term "sars-cov-2 trial vaccine." Look for the data in the pubmed database, and then retrieve the details of the paper as shown in lab 7. How many papers were you able to find?

```{r}
#Download the website
website <- xml2::read_html("https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=sars-cov-2+trial+vaccine")

#Find the counts
counts <- xml2::xml_find_first(website, "/html/body/main/div[9]/div[2]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]")

#Turn it into text
counts <- as.character(counts)

#Extract the data using regex
stringr::str_extract(counts, "[0-9,]+")
```

2. Using the list of pubmed ids you retrieved, download each papersâ€™ details using the query parameter rettype = abstract. If you get more than 250 ids, just keep the first 250.
